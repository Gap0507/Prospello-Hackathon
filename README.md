# Prospello-Hackathon
Hackathon Solo

I’ve built the foundational structure for the application, including both frontend and backend. On the backend, I’ve implemented complete CRUD operations for user authentication, user profiles, group management, and expense tracking. On the frontend, I’ve created a basic homepage along with fully functional register and login pages. Upon login, users are directed to a dashboard which currently displays mock data to simulate group and expense information.
